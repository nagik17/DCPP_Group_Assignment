# What is the problem? -
Why does one need a DATA SET? For example, in the current contemporary
world – looking for a recipe with specific ingredients, diet preferences, cuisine,
occasion/festival recipe with specific parameters is highly recommended and many
follow a specific food preference. But it is not easy to find a recipe with a defined
proportion of ingredients and its health effects, as there are so many recipes available on
the internet. At the same time, it is astronomical task to filter out recipes with specific
ingredient from those thousands of recipes out there. Hence, it becomes imperative that
some smart applications be developed that can pull specific information about a recipe
like a diet plan based on given ingredients or a famous delicacy based on the region and
so on.
Indian cuisine reflects an 8000-year history of various groups and cultures
interacting with the Indian subcontinent, leading to diversity of flavours and regional
cuisines found in modern-day India. Later, trade with British and Portuguese influence
added to the already diverse Indian cuisine. For all such smart applications the main
ingredient is a SMART DATA SET.
#What is the solution? –
Data plays a key role as enabler in assisting the resolution to a problem. A very
well-defined database can further help to identify a quick solution with less complexity.
In this assignment, the group of Data Collection students, present an algorithm that
extracts the Indian food recipes and their details using techniques like web crawling and
scraping and perform EDA to analyse the data, all using Python. This dataset can be
further used to create a variety of FOOD RECIPE based applications. For example, a
Smart Chef application can quickly recommend an Indian Cuisine for given set
ingredients in a matter of few nanoseconds and likewise many other such applications can
be built. All this possible given the INDIAN FOOD RECIPE database has that breadth
and depth in its data content and structured to support such applications.
